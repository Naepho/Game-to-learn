This project is based on an idea that Zanarque! had.

## Principle

This entire project is based on an observation : people can easily learn a lot while playing a game. Just look at LoL players. If we can make it so that what is learnt is useful, we can make learning effortless. Moreover, all the small things that people are sometimes interested in but never take the time to investigate could actually be learnt.

## Technical details

This game is made with C++ and SFML. It makes heavy use of classes. The goal is to always go through classes when making the core of the game. This makes it so that there is a lot to do, but it also simplify life in the long term.

## Contributing

Given the small scale of this project, please just create an issue. I'll try to quickly take a look at it, but with University, I can't promise anything.  
Also, see ![Contributing.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
